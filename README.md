# timezone-sync
## Description

This project is simple `PWA` which helps to define exact date and time between two locations (cities). In other words it answers to the question:
> What date&time will be in a location2 if in location1 date&time equals to N


## Additional info
It was written more in a practice purpose with no frameworks (except Workbox). Just vanilla js/css/html.
